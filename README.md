Description:
C++ program that simulates the booting up of an operative system implementing a function to authenticate the user.
Implements the Process class with different attributes as well as methods for changing the state and executing. When executed, a process first changes to running state and then performs a loop that iterates depending on the burst time. After the loop, the remaining time is decremented to 0 and the process changes to terminated state.
Also implements different scheduling methods like FCFS and SJF both preemptive and non-preemptive.

Instructions:
Compile the program, Once running the username for the authenticate user function will be "User5" and the password "Pass321".
